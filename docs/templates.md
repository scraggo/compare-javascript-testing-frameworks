# Templates

These templates shouldn't be tested on their own. They're used to generate multiple tests in their respective directories, `ava`, `jest`, and `mocha`.

Defining `require` paths to files in the templates should be relative to `<root>/test/<runner>` not necessarily relative to the templates directory.
